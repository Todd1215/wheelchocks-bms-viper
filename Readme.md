These are my BMS profiles that I use and have made in BMS. A mention goes out to CaptZeen for his work on the F-16 profile, for which my Viper profile is based off of.

All of these profiles require Helios 1.6.34xx and newer.

I have decided to package each profile into its own Helios16 archive for easy installation. Since I fly both 4.34 and 4.35 at the moment a key file for both BMS versions is provided here for your convenience. Helios 16 provides batteries included for BMS so no need for other window extraction methods. Helios 16 can do that for you and all my profiles have the extractions baked in for easy setup and go. No need to fus with YAME or MFDE (unless you'd rather use those extraction methods).

My profiles have integrated checklists,charts for KTO and Balkins. It also has integration for Weapon Delivery Planner but requires some setup in order to attain the integration. All is need for that is to either place WDP image files in {Helios}/Images/Datacards directory or use a shortcut from WDP datacards location and link it to the {Helios}/Images/Datacards directory.
