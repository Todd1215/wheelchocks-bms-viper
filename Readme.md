These are my profiles that I use in BMS. They require Helios 1.6. The basis for the profile 'F16C-BMS' is based off of CaptZeen's wonderful work on the F-16C profile he did for DCS. This profile is from his version 0.5 which is just the front panel. There are also some images that were pulled from other various profiles like Ice's BMS profile that are used here. There is no need to use YAME or MFDE as this profile provides all window exports and gauges.

My key file is included in the root of the directory, it is based on the BMS Full key file but is not the default BMS Full Key File. I use Alternate Launcher so the key file has to remain with that name. So if you are going to try this profile I sugest you backup your existing BMS Full Key file and put this one in its place. I also have a Hybrid HOTAS setup, FSSBR3L stick and a warthog Throttle. So you may have to make some adjustments in the HOTAS section of the Key file.

The F16C-BMS profile has integrated checklists,charts for KTO and Balkins. It also has integration for Weapon Delivery Planner. All is need for that is to either place WDP image files in {Helios}/Images/Datacards directory or use a shortcut from WDP datacards location and link it to the {Helios}/Images/Datacards directory.

This profile is a work-in-progress but I've used this one for awhile now and I like.

Enjoy!!
